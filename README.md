<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

A small proof of concept FastaApi that shows how to create a really
simple app with one route via the [routers
mechanism](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#apirouter).

If there are any questions, do not hesitate to set up an issue ğŸ˜Š.

## Install

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/MeesMolenaar/fastapi-nbdev.git
```

## Running the Application

Whenever you change main, a route or add a route. You will have to run
`nbdev_export` so that your package is updated.

> nbdev_export: Export notebooks in `path` to Python modules

After running above comamand, you can start the FastAPI app with the
following command from the root folder (i.e.Â fastapi-nbdev):

> uvicorn fastapi_nbdev.main:app â€“reload

Lastly, run `nbdev_prepare`. This is last, since you want to export and
run your changes before running the tests.

> nbdev_prepare: Export, test, and clean notebooks, and render README if
> needed
